Crazy proof of concept for a Windows application that could be used to onboard users for NodeSchool

Highly experimental

# Overview
Conceived as part of a conversation at NodeConf regarding getting more people into programming via
NodeSchool. One hurdle outlined was the difficulty for Windows users to get up and running.

Using the equally insane [Edge.js](https://github.com/tjanczuk/edge) project, this shows a proof of
concept of potentially creating a standalone Windows application that can introduce a user to Node
and let them run actual code on their own system.

# How To Run
This was built using the VS 2013 Community Edition, so at least that. Also needs the .NET 4.5 framework

Before running, make sure to install the dependencies using NuGet.

After that, just click the Run button (I hope).

# Vision
There may be a way to let Windows users run NodeSchool workshops without needing to install Node
itself or worry about touching the command line until they have gained enough experience to be
able to tackle those issues.
